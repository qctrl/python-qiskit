# Q-CTRL Qiskit adapter

The aim of the Q-CTRL Qiskit Adapter package is to provide export functions allowing
users to deploy established error-robust quantum control protocols from the
open literature and defined in Q-CTRL Open Controls on IBM Quantum hardware.

Anyone interested in quantum control is welcome to contribute to this project.
